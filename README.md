Snake and Ladder - C++ Game

🐍🎲 About the Project

This is a console-based Snake and Ladder game written in C++. The game follows the classic board game rules, where players roll a dice to move across the board, avoiding snakes and climbing ladders to reach the final position.

🎮 How to Play

The game is played between two players.

Players take turns rolling the dice.

If a player lands on a ladder, they climb up.

If a player lands on a snake, they slide down.

The first player to reach position 100 wins!
